1) npm i --global nodemon    = This command for download nodemon 
  globally so you can access it in alll in your project
- It is use for atomatic starting server on every chang
- and use it= npx nodemon (path name)

2) req.parms  is a object  

*3) slug is a variable means what we write on searchbar in slug its 
will write in screen if we show on screen

4) What is params 
=> its they give after / data if you create slug then they show that data

5)What is query?
=>comes after ? (Quetion mark)

6)We also serve static file but not directly we want to create 
public folder and on main file write syntax like

app.use (express.static('public'))

so we can access files from that folder if we want multiple 
file access so write same and change file name


 =====Request=====
 1)Get =
 Gets data from server

Used to load pages or fetch data

Data is sent in URL

Safe & read-only

Can be bookmarked & cached

2)Post = 
Give data to server

Express Routing – Simple Notes
✅ What I did

Created main.js

Created routes/blog.js

Used:

app.use('/blog', blog)


Also wrote:

app.get('/blog')

❌ What happened

When I opened /blog

Router response showed

app.get('/blog') did not run

🤔 Why it happened

app.use('/blog') runs first

Express checks routes top to bottom

Router / = /blog

First match sends response and stops

⭐ Rule to remember

First matching route always runs in Express

✅ Correct way

Write /blog route only once

Keep all blog routes in routes/blog.js

********************Syntax**********************

1)Create router :=

const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

2)Define routes:=

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Blog home");
});

router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Create blog");
});

3)Export router:=

module.exports = router;

4)Use router in main file=>
const blog =require('./routes/blog') // giving path

app.use("/blog", router);

app.use()

Used to attach middleware or routes

Runs for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE…)

"/blog"

This is the base path

Any URL starting with /blog will match

router

This is an Express Router

Contains blog-related routes

🔹 How it works
In routes/blog.js
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Blog home");
});

router.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Blog about");
});

In main.js
app.use("/blog", router);

🔹 Final URLs
Router code	Actual URL
router.get("/")	/blog
router.get("/about")	/blog/about
🧠 Execution Flow
Request → /blog/about
   ↓
app.use("/blog", router)
   ↓
router.get("/about")
   ↓
Response sent

⭐ One-line definition (for notes)

app.use("/blog", router) mounts all blog routes under the /blog URL.

If you want, I can also explain:

app.use() vs app.get()

Why router / becomes /blog

Middleware flow in Express
